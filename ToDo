Goal:
-----

 > Use the molup library
 Problem -> molup libary uses fopen function
         -> fopen function is normally provided by newlib
         -> for our custom case, we need to use the fafts f_open functions
         -> The solution is to make a fopen function, compatible with the newlib call,
            and which is implemented using the fatfs routines

 > Question:
 -----------
 
 1-> do I need, at any time, to remove the dependancy with newlib ?
   > What code is using newlib ? (fatfs? stm32?)

 2-> Is it possible to just define a new fopen function while keeping the existing
     dependancy on newlib ?
    >> NO
 
 3->
